                I, <a href="file:///C:/Users/rphongs0/Documents/GitHub/richycpcc.github.io/richyintroduction.html"> Richy B. Phongsavath </a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2022, CRO7000:01, CO Programming  with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
                </p>
                <p>
                I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
                </p>
                <p>       
                I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
                </p>
                <p>        
                I also understand that given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I have have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
                </p>
