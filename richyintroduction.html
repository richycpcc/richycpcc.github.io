            Personal background:  My name is Richy Phongsavath. I recently moved back to Charlotte, NC from Columbia, SC last week. I went to the University of South Carolina for my undergrad and postgrad degrees. I used to work in the nonprofit sector in the finance field for my organization, but I always had an interest in software development.

            I'd also like to share: I recently gained an appreciation for nature and would like to visit all of the National Parks in the US. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.
