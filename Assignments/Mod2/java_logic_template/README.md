# Java Logic

This exercise contains basic logic problems using the Java programming language.

To complete the exercise, provide a working implementation for each method.

### Setup

1. Open the project in IntelliJ
2. Provide solutions to each of the methods in the LogicExercise class, following the instructions
   in the comments.

### Testing Your Solutions

A number of unit tests have been written to test the implementation of each method.

To test your solutions:

1. Make sure the test/java folder is Marked as the Test Sources Root (java folder should be green).
   If not, right click on the java folder and click Mark Directory as -> Test Sources Root.
2. Open the LogicExerciseTest class and right click on the test of the method you are trying to
   test. For example, the test named 'testGetGradeA' is testing the method getGrade with a value
   which should return 'A'.
3. A dialog should appear and indicate whether the test passed or failed.
4. To run all of the tests, you can right click on the LogicExerciseTest class and click Run
   LogicExerciseTest.
