# Mocking with Mockito

### Utilizing Mockito for unit tests

This project illustrates how to utilize Mockito to test an existing service in a REST Api created
with Spring Data.

Interaction with the repositories has been mocked so that interaction with the database is not
necessary in order to complete the unit tests.
